\chapter{Introduction}
The \textit{Reception And Transmission System}, or RATS for short, is aimed
at scenarios where data is being received from various sources, processed
and then transmitted to various destinations again. It simplifies the design
of flows that handle these kind of scenarios, by providing off-the-shelf
\textit{receivers} and \textit{transmitters}, e.g., for directory polling
or FTPing files.

In contrast to regular ADAMS flows, the RATS sub-system is event-driven
and not data-driven. The received data can then be processed by a data-driven
flow before sending it somewhere else.

\section{Actors}
The following standalone actors are available:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Rats} -- This standalone encloses multiple RAT configurations.
	\item \textit{Rat} -- Definition of how to receive data and how to transmit 
	it, based on the specified \textit{RatInput} (= receiver) and 
	\textit{RatOutput} (= transmitter).
	\item \textit{RatPlague} -- creates copies of itself, one for each of
	the defined input queues, feeding into the same output queue.
	\item \textit{LabRat} -- the actual Rat setup gets generated at runtime
	using a generator.
\end{itemize}
The following control actors are available:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{ChangeRatState} -- changes the state (eg RUNNING, PAUSED)
	of a \textit{Rat} actor. This allows the startup of Rat actors in a
	paused state before activating them later on.
	\item \textit{ExecuteRats} -- allows the execution of Rat actor(s) in
	\textit{MANUAL} mode whenever a token passes through.
\end{itemize}

\section{Remote commands}
The Rats module has some additional remote commands that allow the control of
individual \textit{Rat} actors, as long as they have been flagged to show up in a
\textit{RatControl} actor and such an actor is also present in the flow.

Available commands:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item \textit{flow.GetRatControlStatus} -- returns the status
  (stoppable/isstopped/pausable/ispaused) for all the registered Rat actors
  \item \textit{flow.SendRatControlCommand} -- sends the specified control command
  to a specific Rat actor (pause/resume/stop/start)
\end{tight_itemize}
