\chapter{CNTK}
CNTK, the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit\cite{cntk}, is a deeplearning C++
library which can be configured via the BrainScript Network
Builder\footnote{\url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/BrainScript-Network-Builder}{}}
or Python. It comes with binaries for 64-bit Windows and Linux. It has
experimetnal bindings for Java as well, but only for prediction time.

\section{Installation}
Follow the installation instructions for CNTK: \\
\url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine}{} \\

\noindent For the Java bindings to work, you need to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Download binaries for your platform.
  \item Create a new directory to contain all the libraries
  \item Copy the libraries from the \textit{lib} and \textit{dependencies/lib}
  directories into the newly created directory. For older Linux versions that
  required a custom build of the openmpi libraries, copy these libraries as well.
  \item Either supply the new library directory to the JVM using
  \textit{-Djava.library.path=...}, or, when using the \textit{Launcher} class,
  (package \textit{adams.core.management}), you can use the
  \textit{ADAMS\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable to supply the directory.
  The launcher will automatically add the content of the variable to the
  command-line.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Flow}
The following standalines are available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{CNTKSetup} -- for overriding the global CNTK settings.
\end{itemize}
The following sources are available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{CNTKModelGenerator} -- uses the specified model generator
  to output model specification strings.
\end{itemize}
The following transformers are available:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{CNTKModelApplier} -- uses the specified model applier to the
  incoming data.
  \item \textit{CNTKModelInfo} -- outputs information about the incoming model.
  \item \textit{CNTKModelReader} -- reads a CNTK model from disk.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Open MPI}

When installing the LLVM version of the Open MPI library on Ubuntu (and
derivatives), CNTK will not find the \texttt{libiomp5.so} library, as it
is called \texttt{libomp.so.5}. You can simply symlink the library as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s libomp.so.5 libiomp5.so
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Intel MKL}
Intel provides high-performance BLAS libraries for download as well\cite{mkl}:

After installation, you have to add the libraries to your environment
variables for CNTK to pick up.

\noindent First, locate the directory that contains the MKL runtime library:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item Linux/OSX: \texttt{libmkl\_rt.so}
  \item Windows: \texttt{mkl\_rt.dll}
\end{tight_itemize}

\noindent Second, add this directory to your environment variables:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item Linux/OSX: add the path to \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}
    \begin{verbatim}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/mkl_rt
    \end{verbatim}
  \item Windows: add the path to your \texttt{\%PATH\%} variable, either
  through the control panel or on the command prompt:
    \begin{verbatim}
    set PATH=%PATH%:path\to\mkl_rt
    \end{verbatim}
\end{tight_itemize}

\noindent Furthermore, for Windows you also need to add the OpenMP runtime
libraries to the path. Locate the directory that contains the
\texttt{libiomp5md.dll} library and add this directory to your \texttt{\%PATH\%}
environment variable as well.
